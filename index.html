    <h1>no teasing</h1>
    <h2>Hi welcome to my no teasing game/lesson</h2>
    <p>Hi guys this is about people tease and it a game too. Sometimes when people tease the just wanna be mean and make fun of you. 
    They do it because they think they are better than you.</p>
    <p>Here are the dicrections for my game. First you create a character either boy or girl anyway you want. Then you use the arrows you walk outside your door. When you walk out the door you see a girl that bullies you alot. She calls you nerdy girl. On the rest of your way to school you think of 20 soulotions to avoid people teasing you. To do yourself a favor, if you are being bullied in real life please ONLY 1 physical thing. Have fun playing this game. </p>
